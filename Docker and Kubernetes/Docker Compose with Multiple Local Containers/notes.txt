 - We're going to have 4 docker containers, where 3 point to a "parent" container
 - Check the code under:
    - index.js
    - package.json


 - Docker Compose
    - Used to connect 2 containers together by starting multiple containers at the same time
    - It is a separate CLI
    - Check the docker-compose.yml file to see how it's built
    - You don't necessarily need to set ports in the docker-compose file to get the containers to connect:
        - In this case, it's used to ensure we can access it from the local machine
    - Commands:
        - docker-compose up
            - equivalent to docker run myimage
        - docker-compose up --build
            - equivalent to:
                - docker build .
                - docker run myimage

 - Stopping Docker Compose containers
    - Launch in background
        - docker-compose up -d
    - Stop containers
        - docker-compose down


 - Container Maintenance with Compose
    - Due to the added code in index.js, the container has crashed and no longer appears under docker ps
    - To automatically restart a crashed container:
        - 4 different restart policies:
            - "no"
                - Set by default
                - Never attempt to restart this . container if it stops or crashes
            - always
                - If this container stops *for any reason* always attempt to restart it
            - on-failure
                - Only restart if the container stops with an error code
            - unless-stopped
                - Always restart unless we (the developers) forcibly stop it
        To add a restart policy:
            - Check the docker-compose yaml file
            - It is set right after the node-app
