We will be creating an IAM user and then generating a key pair for deployment. There is a minor required change to this flow. Instead of being prompted to create a key pair during the IAM user creation, you must first create the IAM user, then, create a key pair associated with that user. AWS has also changed the terminology from Programmatic Access, to Command Line Interface (CLI).
