 - You'll probably want to clean up your list of containers that have been stopped at some point
 - Can be done with docker rm [name]
 - You will get an error if you try to remove a running container, you will get an error
    - ie containers must be stopped before being removed
 - You can pass multiple containers names to the rm command
 - You can also use docker container prune to remove all stopped containers

 - For images,
    - docker images lists all images that you have
    - To remove a image, you can use docker rmi [image_name]
    - You can only remove an image if they are not being used by a container (even stopped ones!)
    - Also has the docker image prune command which removes all unused images

- Removing Stopped Containers automatically
    - --rm flag automaitcally removes the container when it exits
    - Add to the run command to use it, example:
        - docker run -d --rm [name]
            - Runs a specific container in detached mode and once it is stopped, it is removed
