- Finding/Creating Images
    - hub.docker.com
    - Search for the type of image you want
        - IE "node" for node.js Images
    - In CLI:
        - docker run node
        - This will pull and run the node image 
            - If the image isn't already on the local machine, it will download the image first and then run the container
        - If you want to just download the image:
            - docker pull [image]
        - Each image will have the command to be used on the page for it.
