- Open terminal
- In CLI:
    - docker build [path to find dockerfile]
    - can use . to specify that the dockerfile is in the folder you are currently located in
- Once built
    - Copy the ID that is generated
    - docker run [container id]
    - If you have EXPOSE set in your dockerfile, it is used more for documnetation purposes more than anything
    - need to add the extra flag "-p [localport:port to be exposed]" on the run command to allow access to the port to be used (or local port for testing)

- Important to know
    - Images are read-only!
    - They are not dynamic
    - You need to stop the container, re-build the image, then run the container again
        - you can not simply restart the container to pull changes made to an application
