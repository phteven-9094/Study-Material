- Create a new file named Dockerfile
    - No extension needed
    - For an example:
        - FROM node
            - copies an existing base image
        - WORKDIR /app 
            - Sets the working directory
            - Tells Docker that all of the proceeding commands will be run in this directory
        - COPY . .
            - First dot is host directory
            - Second dot is the container directory
            - Can do something like Copy . /app
            - Will want to use the documnetation to see all possibilities
        - RUN npm install
            - A command that the container will need to run in the working directory of the image
        - EXPOSE 80
            - Exposes a port for the container to listen on if necessary
            - Technically optional, but recommended
        - CMD ["node", "server.js"]
            - Tells Docker to run the node command to run the server.js file 
        
- The file will contain the instructions for Docker to execute to build an image.
