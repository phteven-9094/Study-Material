    - We'll be generating a Project with a Project Generator
    - We'll be making a React application and wrap it in a container



- Make sure Node.JS is installed
    - node -v to check the version
    - If no version appears, download node js by googling for it
- To generate the project
    - npx create-react-app <projectname>
        - In this case, it will be found under the folder "frontend"
- Necessary Commands:
    - npm run start
        - Starts up a development server. For development use only.
    - npm run test 
        - Runs tests associated with the project.
    - npm run build
        - Builds a production version of the application
    - Keep in mind, these commands are specific to JavaScript, but there will be other commands for other languages as well
- Creating the Dev Dockerfile
    - We'l end up with 2 Dockerfiles: one for Dev and one for production
    - For the Dev Dockerfile, the changes will be in the file Dockerfile.dev in the frontend folder.
    - To run the custom-named Dockerfile:
        - docker build - f Dockerfile.dev
            - The -f flag is telling docker that we want to specify what file to use
    - To run the dev container
        - Get the image ID
        - docker run -p 3000:3000 <imageid>
- Docker Volumes
    - Instead of doing the straight COPY ..
    - We'll adjust the docker run command
    - We'll be using docker volumes which essentially sets up a placeholder in the container
        - These placeholders are essentially references to your local machine
            - Similar to the port mapping we've been doing
    - Syntax:
        - docker run -p 3000:3000 -v /app/node_modules -v $(pwd):/app <image_id>
                                                        ^ get the present working directory and take the folder and everything inside it, map to the app folder in the container
                                    ^ Put a bookmark on the node_modules folder
                    ^ port mapping
        - This will not work on a Windows machine if you are using CMD Promt or Powershell
            - Note: If you are using Git Bash, it will work
