 - Say you have a container that is running Redis and Redis-CLI, you want to be able to run commands in the container
 - You can do so with the following command
    - docker exec -it <container id> <command>
    - -it allows us to provide input to the container
    - <command> is the cli command you want to execute

Getting a Command Prompt in a container
    - To avoid running docker exec everytime, you can:
        - docker exec -it <container id> sh
            - This will "open" a shell/terminal in the container
            - Can use bash, powershell, zsh depending on what you want to use
                - Vast majority will have sh, though a lot can have bash as well

Starting with a Shell
    - To start a container with a shell:
        - docker run -it <container image> sh
        - Common to have a container that does a primary process, and then attach a shell with the above section
