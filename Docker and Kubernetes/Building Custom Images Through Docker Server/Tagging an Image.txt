- Instead of having to remember the generated name or the ID, you can tag the image in the build command:
    - docker build -t [dockerid][name]:[version]
    - Example:
        - docker build -t email/myfirstcontainer:latest .
    - You don't have to use the version necessarily, if left out, Docker will run the latest image by default
