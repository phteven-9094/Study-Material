	• An alternative to merging
		○ Can be used as a cleanup tool
	• Rebasing moves the entire feature branch so that it BEGINS at the tip of the master branch.
	• All of the work is still there, but we have re-written history
	• Instead of using a merge commit, rebasing rewrites history by creating new commits for each of the original feature branches.
	• Commands:
		○ Git switch feature
		○ Git rebase master
	• When NOT to Rebase
		○ Never rebase commits that have been shared with others.
		○ If you have already pushed commits up to GitHub. DO NOT rebase them unless you are positive no one on the team is using those commits.
        You do not want to rewrite any git history that other people already have. It's a pain to reconcile rewritten histories.
