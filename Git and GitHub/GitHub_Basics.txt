	• Cloning GitHub Repos with Git Clone
		○ Can clone a remote repo hosted on GitHub. 
			▪ All we need is a URL that we can tell Git to clone for use
	• To clone a repo, simply run git clone <url>
		○ Git will retrieve all the files associated with the repo and will copy them to your local machine.
	• Github Setup: SSH Config
		○ Check for existing SSH Keys
			▪ Use ls -al ~/.ssh 
				• Lists the files in your .ssh directory, if they exist
			▪ To make a new key, follow the directions here
			▪ Add the SSH key to the ssh-agent by following the directions here
			▪ Add a new SSH key to your Github account by following the directions here
	• Creating a GitHub repo
		○ Create an empty repo in GitHub
		○ Either use a current repo or init a repo on your local machine
		○ Setup a Git Remote
			▪ Essentially a destination URL for Github to know about the local repo
			▪ Start with git remote or git remote –v (verbose, for more info)
				• This lists any remote you have in the repo
			▪ To create a new remote, run
				• Git remote add <name> <url>
				• Origin is a commonly used name
		○ You can rename your branch by using git branch –M <name>
		○ Push the first commit using:
			▪ Git push –u <remote> <branch>
			▪ Example: git push –u origin main
	• Pushing
		○ To push up to GitHub, you need the remote AND the specific local branch
			▪ For example, git push origin main
		○ What is push –u?
			▪ The –u option allows us to set the upstream of the branch we are pushing. You can think of this as a link connecting our local branch to a branch on GitHub
			▪ Running git push –u origin master sets the upstream of the local master branch so that it tracks the master branch on the origin repo
			▪ Once the upstream has been setup with –u, you can push the branch you are on with just git push.
	• Push In Detail
		○ While we often want to push a local branch up to a remote branch of the same name, we don't have to
		○ To push our local pancake branch up to a remote branch called waffle, we could do:
			▪ Git push origin pancake:waffle
                Git push <remote> <local-branch>:<remote-branch>
