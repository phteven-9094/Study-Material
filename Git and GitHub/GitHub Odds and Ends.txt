• READMEs
	• A README file is used to communicate important info about a repo, including:
		○ What the project does
		○ How to run the project
		○ Why it's noteworthy
		○ Who maintains the project
	• When creating a more extensive README, research Markdown
• GitHub Gists
	• Simple way to share code snippets and useful fragments with others. 
	• Gists are much easier to create, but offer far fewer features than a typical GitHub repo.
• GitHub Pages
	• Public websites that are hosted and published via GitHub.
	• They allow you to create a website simply by pushing your code to GitHub.
	• GitHub pages is a hosting service for static webpages, so it does not support server-side code like Python, Ruby, or Node. Just HTML/CSS/JS
	• User Sites
		○ You get one user stie per github account. This is where you could host a portfolio site or some form of personal website.
		○ The default URL is based on your GitHub username following this pattern: username.github.io though you can change this
	• Project Sites
		○ You get unlimited project sites. Each GitHub repo can have a corresponding hosted website. 
It's as simple as telling GitHub which specific branch contains the web content. The default URLs follow this pattern: username.github.io/repo-name
