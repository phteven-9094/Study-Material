	• We can tell Git which files and directories to ignore in a given repo, using a .gitignore file.
	• This is useful for files you know you NEVER want to commit, including:
		○ Secrets, API keys, creds, etc
		○ OS files
		○ Log Files
		○ Dependencies & packages
	• .gitignore
		○ Create a file called .gitignore in the root of the repo.
		○ Inside the file, we can write patterns to tell Git which file & folders to ignore:
			▪ .DS_Store will ignore files named .DS_Store
			▪ FolderName/ will ignore an entire directory
                *.log will ignore any files with the .log extension
