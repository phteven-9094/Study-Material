	• Tags are pointers that refer to particular points in Git history.
		○ Most often used to mark version releases for projects (v4.1.0, v7.1.1, etc)
	• Lightweight tags
		○ Usually just a name/label that points to a particular commit
	• Annotated tags
		○ Stores extra meta data such as  authors name and email, the date, and a tagging message (like a commit message)
	• Semantic Versioning
		○ Set of rules and requirements that determine how version numbers are decided
		○ First Number – Major Release
		○ Second Number – Minor Release
		○ 3rd Number = Patch
		○ Initial release may be 1.0.0
			▪ Patch releases, such as bug fixes, might change it to 1.0.1
				• IE, changes that don't impact how the code is used
			▪ A minor release such as a new feature or functionality, but the project is still backwards compatible. The new functionality is optional and should not force users to rewrite their own code.
			▪ You would reset the patch counter, so a minor release would be 1.1.0.
			▪ The next Major release signifies changes that is no longer backwards compatible, which would reset the last 2 numbers while incrementing the first one (2.0.0)
	• Viewing & Searching Tags
		○ Git tag will print a list of all the tags in the current repo
		○ Can search by using git tag –l <search> ("v17x")
		○ Can use git show <tag> to show the tag
	• Creating Lightweight tags
		○ Git tag <tagname>
			▪ By default, Git will create the tag referring too the commit that HEAD is referencing. Essentially the most recent commit on the current branch.
	• Creating Annotated Tags
		○ Git tag –a
			▪ Git will then open your default text editor and prompt you for additional information.
			▪ Similar to git commit, we can also use the –m option to pass a message directly and forgo the opening of the text editor.
	• Tagging previous commits
		○ Git tag <tagname> <commit-hash>
	• Replacing tags with force
		○ Git tag –f <tagname>
	• Deleting Tags
		○ Git tag –d <tagname>
	• Pushing Tags
		○ Git push –tags
		○ Git push remote (origin) <tagname>
            By default, the git push command doesn't transfer tags to remote servers.
