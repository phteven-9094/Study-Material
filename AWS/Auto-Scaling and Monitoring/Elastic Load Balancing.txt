	• Distributes incoming application or network traffic across multiple targets in a single AZ or across multiple AZs
	• Scales your load balancer as traffic to your application changes over time
	• Types:
		○ Application Load Balancer
			▪ Load balancing of HTTP & HTTPS traffic
			▪ Routes traffic to targets based on content of request
			▪ Provides advanced request routing targeted at the delivery of modern application architectures, including microservices and containers
			▪ Operates at the application layer (OSI Layer 7)
		○ Network Load Balancer
			▪ Load balancing of TCP,UDP, and TLS traffic where extreme performance is required
			▪ Routes traffic to targets based on IP protocol data
			▪ Can handle millions of requests per second while maintaining ultra-low latencies
			▪ Is optimized to handle sudden and volatile traffic patterns
			▪ Operates at the transport layer (OSI Layer 4)
		○ Class Load Balancer (Previous Generation)
			▪ Load balancing of HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, and SSL Traffic
			▪ Load balancing across multiple EC2 instances
			▪ Operates at both the application and transport layers
	• Use Cases
		○ Highly available and fault-tolerant applications
		○ Containerized Applications
		○ Elasticity and scalability
		○ VPC
		○ Hybrid environments
		○ Invoke Lambda functions over HTTP(S)
	• Monitoring
		○ Amazon CloudWatch Metrics
			▪ Used to verify that the system is performing as expected and creates an alarm to initiate an action if a metric goes outside an acceptable range
		○ Access logs
			▪ Capture detailed information about requests sent to your load balancer
		○ AWS CloudTrail logs
