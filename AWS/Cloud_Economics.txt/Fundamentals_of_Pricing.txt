	• 3 fundamental drivers of cost with AWS:
		○ Compute
			▪ Charged per hour/second
				• Linux is only charged by second
		○ Storage
			▪ Charged typically per GB
		○ Data Transfer
			▪ Outbound is aggregated and charged
			▪ Inbound has no charge (with some exceptions)
			▪ Charged typically per GB
	• How do you pay for AWS?
		○ Pay for what you use
		○ Pay less when you reserve
		○ Pay less when you use more and as AWS grows
	• Pay for what you use:
		○ Pay only for the services that you consume, with no large upfront expenses
	• Pay less when you reserve:
		○ Invest in Reserved Instances (RIs):
			▪ Save up to 75%
			▪ Options:
				• All Upfront Reserved Instance (AURI) = Largest discount
				• Partial Upfront Reserved Instance (PURI) = Lower discounts
				• No Upfront Payments Reserved Instance (NURI) = Smaller discounts
	• Pay less by using more:
		○ Realize volume-based discounts:
			▪ Savings as usage increases
			▪ Tiered pricing for services like S3, EBS, EFS > the more you use, the less you pay per GB
			▪ Multiple storage services deliver lower storage costs based on needs
	• Pay even less as AWS Grows:
		○ As AWS grows:
			▪ AWS focuses on lowering cost of doing business
			▪ This practice results in AWS passing savings from economies of scale to you
			▪ Since 2006, AWS has lowered pricing 75 times
			▪ Future higher-performing resources replace current resources for no extra charge.
