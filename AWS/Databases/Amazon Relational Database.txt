	• Unmanaged vs Managed Services:
		○ Unmanaged
			▪ Scaling, fault tolerance, and availability are managed by you
			▪ Typically provisioned in discrete portions as specified by the user.
			▪ You must manage how the service responds to changes in load, errors, and situations where resources become unavailable.
			▪ Essentially controlled by the user/you and not Amazon
		○ Managed:
			▪ Scaling, fault tolerance, and availability are typically built into the service
			▪ Requires the user to configure them
			▪ Usually require less configuration though
	• Challenges of relational databases
		○ Server maintenance and energy footprint
		○ Software installation and patches
		○ Database backups and high availability
		○ Limits on scalability
		○ Data security
		○ OS installation and patches
	• Amazon RDS
		○ Managed service that sets up and operates a relational database in the cloud
		○ Currently supports 6 databases:
			▪ MySQL
			▪ Amazon Aurora
			▪ Microsoft SQL Server
			▪ PostgreSQL
			▪ MariaDB
			▪ Oracle
	• Amazon RDS Read Replicas
		○ Features:
			▪ Offers asynchronous replication
			▪ Can be promoted to master if needed
		○ Functionality
			▪ Use for read-heavy database workloads
			▪ Offload read queries
	• When to use Amazon RDS
		○ Use:
			▪ Complex transactions or complex queries
			▪ A medium to high query or write rate
				• Up to 30k IOPS
			▪ No more than a single worker node or shard
			▪ High durability
		○ Do Not Use
			▪ Massive read/write rates
			▪ Sharding due to high data size or throughput demands
			▪ Simple GET or PUT requests and queries that a NoSQL database can handle

RDS Types
	• Clock-hour billing
		○ Resources incur charges when running
	• Database characteristics
		○ Physical capacity of database
			▪ Engine
			▪ Size
			▪ Memory Class
	• DB Purchase type
		○ On-Demand instances
			▪ Compute capacity by the hour
		○ Reserved Instances
			▪ Low, one-time, upfront payment for database instances that are reserved with a 1 year or 3 year term
	• Number of DB instances
		○ Provision multiple DB instances to handle peak loads
	• Storage
		○ Provisioned storage
			▪ No Charge
				• Backup storage of up to 100% of database storage for an active
			▪ Charge (GB/month)
				• Backup storage for terminated DB instances
		○ Additional storage
			▪ Charge (GB/month)
				• Backup storage in addition to provisioned storage
	• Deployment type and Data transfer
		○ Requests
			▪ The number of input and output requests that are made to the database
		○ Deployment type – Storage and I/O charges vary, depending on whether you deploy to:
			▪ Single AZ
			▪ Multiple AZs
		○ Data transfer
			▪ No charge for inbound data transfer
            - Tiered charges for outbound data transfer
