	• The AWS Global Infrastructure is designed and built to deliver a flexible, reliable, scalable, and secure cloud computing environment with high-quality global network performance.
	• The map in https://infrastructure.aws shows the current AWS Regions and more that are coming soon.
	• AWS Regions:
		○ An AWS Region is a geographical area.
			▪ Data replication across Regions is controlled by you.
			▪ Communication between Regions uses AWS backbone network infrastructure.
		○ Each Region provides full redundancy and connectivity to the network
		○ A Region typically consists of two or more Availability Zones.
	• Availability Zones:
		○ Each Region has multiple Availability Zones.
		○ Each AZ is a fully isolated partition of the AWS infrastructure.
			▪ There are currently 69 AZs worldwide
			▪ AZs consist of discrete data centers
			▪ They are designed for fault isolation
			▪ They are interconnected with other AZs by using high-speed private networking
			▪ You choose your AZ
			▪ AWS recommends replicated data and resources across AZs for resiliency.
	• AWS Data Centers
		○ AWS data centers are designed for security.
		○ Data centers are where the data resides and data processing occurs
		○ Each data center has redundant power, networking, and connectivity, and is housed in a separate facility
		○ A data center typically has 50,000– 80,000 physical servers.
	• Points of Presence
		○ AWS provides a global network of 187 Points of Presence locations.
		○ Consists of 176 edge locations and 11 Regional edge caches
		○ Used with Amazon CloudFront
			▪ A global Content Delivery Network that delivers content to end users with reduced latency.
		○ Regional edge caches used for content with infrequent access.
	• AWS infrastructure features
		○ Elasticity and scalability
			▪ Elastic infrastructure; dynamic adaption of capacity
			▪ Scalable infrastructure; adapts to accommodate growth
		○ Fault Tolerance
			▪ Continues operating properly in the presence of a failure
			▪ Build-in redundancy of components
		○ High availability
			▪ High level of operational performance
			▪ Minimized downtime
