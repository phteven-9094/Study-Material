- Simplifies the task of repeatedly and predictably creating groups of related resources that power your applications.
- Interact in 3 ways:
    - AWS Management Console
    - AWS CLI
    - AWS SDK/API
- Fully managed service
    - Can create, update, and delete resources in stacks
- Template file + AWS CloudFormation -> Stack
- Stack:
    - Resouces generated by a Template
    - Unit of deployment
    - Create Stack
    - Update stacks
    - Delete stacks
        - When you delete a stack, all resources in the stack are deleted by default as well
- Template File:
    - Resources to provision
    - Text file in JSON or YAML Format.
    - Self-Documenting Environment
    - Same information you would specify if you manually created resources in AWS management Console
    - You don't have to list resources in order, you can use the depends on attribute
    - Example of Infra as Code
- 2 requirement for running CloudFormation:
    - Templates
        - if there is an error, CF will completely rollback
    - Permissions
        - Person must have permissions to all resources mentioned in the template
