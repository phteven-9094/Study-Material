- VPC Sharing
	• VPC sharing enables customers to share subnets with other AWS accounts in the same org as AWS Organizations.
	• VPC sharing enables multiple AWS accounts to create their application resources into shared, centrally managed VPCs.
	• Several benefits:
		○ Separation of duties
		○ Ownership
		○ Security groups
		○ Efficiencies
		○ No hard limits
        - Optimized costs

- VPC Peering
	• Networking connection between 2 VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them privately. Instances in either VPC can communicate with each other as if they are within the same network. You can create a VPC peering connection between your own VPCs, with a VPC in another AWS account, or with a VPC in a different AWS region.
	• When you set up the peering connection, you create rules in your route table to allow the VPCs to communicate with each other through the peering resource.
	• Restrictions:
		○ IP address ranges cannot overlap
		○ Transitive peering is not support
        - You can only have one peering resource between the same two VPCs.

- Site-to-Site VPN
	• By default, instances that you launch into a VPC cannot communicate with a remote network. To connect your VPC to your remote network, you:
		○ Create a new virtual gateway device
		○ Define the configuration of the VPN device or the customer gateway
		○ Create a custom route table to point corporate data center-bound traffic to the VPN gateway
		○ Establish an AWS Site-to-Stie VPN connection to link the two systems together
        - Configure routing to pass traffic through the connection
