	• Internet Gateway
		○ Scalable, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet.
		○ Serves 2 purposes
			▪ Provide a target in your VPC route tables for internet-routable traffic
			▪ Perform network address translations for instances that were assigned public IPv4 addresses.
		○ To make a subnet public, you attach an internet gateway to your VPC and add a route to the route table to send non-local traffic through the internet gateway to the internet.
	• Network Address Translation (NAT) Gateway
		○ Enables instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet or other AWS services, but prevents the internet from initiating a connection with those instances.
		○ To create a NAT gateway, you must specify the public subnet in which the NAT gateway should reside. You must also specify an Elastic IP address to associate with the NAT gateway when you create it. After you create a NAT gateway, you must update the route table that is associated with one or more of your private subnets to point internet-bound traffic to the NAT gateway. Thus, instances in your private subnets can communicate with the internet.
        - You can also use a NAT instance in a public subnet in your VPC instead of a NAT gateway. However, a NAT gateway is a managed NAT service that provides better availability, higher bandwidth, and less admin effort.
