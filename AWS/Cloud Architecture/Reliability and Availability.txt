	• Reliability
		○ A measure of your systems ability to provide functionality when desired by the user
		○ System includes all systems components: hardware, firmware, and software
		○ Probability that your entire system will function as intended for a specified period
		○ Mean time between failures (MTBF) = total time in service/number of failures
	• Availability
		○ Normal operation time / total time
		○ A percentage of uptime (for example, 99.9%) over time (for example, 1 year)
		○ Number of 9s = 5 9s means 99.999 % availability
	• High Availability
		○ System can withstand some measure of degradation while still remaining available
		○ Downtime is minimized
		○ Minimal human intervention is required
	• Factors that influence Availability
		○ Fault Tolerance
			▪ The built-in redundancy of an application's components and it's ability to remain operational
		○ Scalability
			▪ The ability of an application to accommodate increases in capacity needs without changing design
		○ Recoverability
            - The process, policies, and procedures that are related to restoring services after a catastrophic event
