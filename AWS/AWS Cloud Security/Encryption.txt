- Encryption of Data At Rest
	• Encryption encodes data with a secret key, which makes it unreadable
		○ Only those who have the secret key can decode the data
		○ AWS KMS can manage your secret keys
	• AWS supports encryption of data at rest
		○ Data at rest = Data stored physically (on disk or on tape)
		○ You can encrypt data stored in any service that is supported by AWS KMS, including:
			▪ S3
			▪ EBS
			▪ EFS
            - RDS managed databases
- Encryption of Data in Transit
	• Encryption of data in transit (data moving across a network)
		○ Transport Layer Security (TLS) - formerly SSL – is an open standard protocol
		○ AWS certificate manager provides a way to manage, deploy, and renew TLS or SSL certificates
	• Secure HTTP (HTTPS) creates a secure tunnel
    - Uses TLS or SSL for the bidirectional exchange to data
