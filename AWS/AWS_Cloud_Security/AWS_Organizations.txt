	• AWS Organizations enables you to consolidate multiple AWS accounts so that you centrally manage them
	• Security features of AWS Organizations:
		○ Group AWS accounts into Organizational Units (OUs) and attach different access policies to each OU.
		○ Integration and support for IAM
			▪ Permissions to a user are the intersection of what is allowed by AWS Organizations and what is granted by IAM in that account
        - Use service control policies to establish control over the AWS services and API actions that each AWS account can access
- Service Control Policies:
	• Service Control Policies (SCPs) offer centralized control over accounts
		○ Limit permissions that are available in an account that is part of an organization
	• Ensures that accounts comply with access control guidelines
	• SCPs are similar to IAM permissions policies:
		○ They use similar syntax
		○ However, an SCP never grants permissions
        - Instead, SCPs specify the maximum permissions for an organization
