Container Basics
	• Containers are a method of OS virtualization
	• Benefits:
		○ Repeatable
		○ Self-contained execution environments
		○ Software runs the same in different environments
        - Faster to launch and stope or terminate than virtual machines

What is Docker?
	• Docker is a software platform that enables you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly
	• You run containers on Docker
		○ Containers are created from a template called an image
	• A container has everything a software application needs to run
	• Best used as a solution when you want to:
		○ Standardize environments
		○ Reduce conflicts between language stacks and versions
		○ Use containers as a service
		○ Run microservices using standardized code deployments
        - Require portability for data processing

Amazon ECS:
	• Amazon Elastic Container Service
		○ A highly scalable, fast, container management service
	• Key benefits
		○ Orchestrates the execution of Docker containers
		○ Maintains and scales the fleet of nodes that run your containers
		○ Removes the complexity of standing up the infrastructure
	• Integrated with features that are familiar to Amazon EC2 service users
		○ Elastic Load Balancing
		○ Amazon EC2 security groups
		○ Amazon EBS volumes
        - IAM roles

What is Kubernetes?
	• Kubernetes is open source software for container orchestration
		○ Deploy and manage containerized applications at scale
		○ The same toolset can be used on premises and in the cloud
	• Complements Docker
		○ Docker enables you to run multiple containers on a single OS host
		○ Kubernetes orchestrates multiple Docker hosts (nodes)
	• Automates
		○ Container provisioning
		○ Networking
		○ Load Distribution
        - Scaling

Amazon EKS:
	• Amazon EKS
		○ Enables you to run Kubernetes on AWS
		○ Certified Kubernetes conformant (supports easy migration)
		○ Supports Linux and Windows containers
		○ Compatible with Kubernetes community tools and supports popular Kubernetes add-ons
	• Use EKS to
		○ Manage clusters of Amazon EC2 compute instances
		○ Run containers that are orchestrated by Kubernetes on those instances

Amazon ECR:
 - A fully managed Docker container registry that makes it easy for developers to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images
