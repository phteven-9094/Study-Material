	• Convert the IP Address and Subnet Mask into Binary

			▪ Carry down the IP address portion of those that correspond with the 1's
	• Create the Network Address
		○ Take the Network portion and for the host portion, set all those bits to 0, then convert the number back to decimal
	• Broadcast Address
