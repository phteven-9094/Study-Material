	• Identify the octet of interest
	• Write out answers so far
		○ Network Address
			▪ Octets to the left are the same
			▪ Octet to the right are 0
		○ Broadcast Address
			▪ Octets to the left are the same
			▪ Octets to the right are 255
	• Calculate block size
	• Find multiple of block size
		○ Network address 
			▪ Just less than or equal to the octet of interest
		○ Broadcast Address
			▪ Add the block size – 1 to the network address number
	• Example:
		○ IP = 172.16.1.1 & Subnet 255.255.224.0
			▪ The octet of interest is the one that is not 255 or 0
			▪ In this case, the 3rd octet
		○ Network Address would be: 172.16. .0
		○ Broadcast: 172.16. .0
		○ To calculate block size, take 256 and subtract the octet of interest
			▪ 256 – 224 = 32
		○ Find the multiples of block size
			▪ Network Address
				• Multiple of the block size (32) that is just less than octet of interest in the IP address, in this case 96 since is a multiple of 32 and just less than 97 
			▪ Broadcast Address
Add the block size – 1 to the network address number
