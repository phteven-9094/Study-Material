	• Data Types
		○ Main Data Types:
			▪ Boolean = True or False
			▪ Character = char, varchar, and text
			▪ Numeric = Integer and floating-point number
			▪ Temporal = date, time, timestamp, and interval
		○ Other Data Types:
			▪ UUID = Universally Unique Identifiers
			▪ Array = Stores an array of strings, numbers, etc
			▪ JSON
			▪ Hstore key-value pair
			▪ Special types such as network address and geometric data
		○ Review documentation to learn the limitations of datatypes when deciding what to use when creating a database
	• Primary and Foreign Keys
		○ A primary key is a column or a group of columns used to identify a row uniquely in a table
			▪ For example, in our dvdrental database we saw customers had a unique, non-null customer_id column as their primary key
			▪ Primary keys are also important since they allow us to easily discern what columns to use when joining tables together.
		○ A Foreign Key is a field or group of fields in a table that uniquely identifies a row in another table.
			▪ Is defined in a table that references to the primary key of the other table
			▪ The table that contains the foreign key is called referencing table or a child table
			▪ The table to which the foreign key references is called references table or parent table
			▪ A table can have multiple foreign keys depending on its relationships with other tables.
		○ When creating tables and defining columns, we can use constraints to define columns as being a primary key, or attaching a foreign key relationship to another table.
	• Constraints
		○ Constraints are the rules enforced on data columns on table.
		○ These are used to prevent invalid data from being entered into the database
		○ This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data in the database.
		○ 2 main categories
			▪ Column Constraints
				• Constraints the data in a column to adhere to certain conditions
			▪ Table Constraints
				• Applied to the entire table rather than to an individual columns
		○ Most common constraints used:
			▪ NOT NULL Constraint
				• Ensures that a column cannot have NULL value
			▪ UNIQUE Constraint
				• Ensures that all values in a column are different
			▪ CHECK
				• Ensures that all values in a column satisfy certain conditions
			▪ EXCLUSION
Ensures that if any two rows are compared on the specified column or expression using the specified operator, not all of these comparisons will return TRUE
