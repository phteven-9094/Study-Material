	• Topics:
		○ A particular stream of data
			▪ Logs
			▪ Purchases
			▪ Twitter_tweets
			▪ Trucks_gps
		○ Similar to a table in a database (without all the constraints)
		○ You can have as many topics as you want
		○ A topic is identified by its name
		○ Any kind of message format
		○ The sequence of messages is called a data stream
		○ You cannot query topics, instead, use Kafka Producers to send data and Kafka Consumers to read the data
	• Partitions and Offsets
		○ Topics are split in partitions
			▪ Messages within each partition are ordered
			▪ Each message within a partition gets an incremental ID, called offset
		○ Kafka topics are immutable: once data is written to a partition, it can't be changed
	• Important Notes
		○ Once the data is written to a partition, it cannot be changed
		○ Data is kept only for a limited time (Default is one week – configurable)
		○ Offset only have a meaning for a specific partition
			▪ Offsets are not re-used even if previous messages have been deleted
		○ Order is guaranteed only within a partition (not across partitions)
        - Data is assigned randomly to a partition unless a key is provided
